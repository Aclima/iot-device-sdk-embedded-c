   DATA:
    a iotc_connection_data_t structure which holds a connection_state parameter
    that can be monitored to determine the health of the connection:

    IOTC_CONNECTION_STATE_OPENED - the connection has been successfully
   established, and TLS handshaking has verified the server certificate.  The
   client is read to publish and subscribe to topics.
    IOTC_CONNECTION_STATE_OPEN_FAILED - there was an error in the connection
        process and the connection could not be made. You can determine the
        reason in the iotc_state_t, which contains a standard IoTC error code.
    IOTC_CONNECTION_STATE_CLOSED - disconnected from Google Cloud IoT Core
   service, with the reason provided in iotc_state_t. Note: there are two
   possible reasons of being disconnected: a) the application initiated the
   disconnection procedure through a call to iotc_shutdown_connection b) there
   has been a problem with maintaining the connection, or the service shutdown
   the connection expectantly.

        Determining which of these scenarios has occured can be done by
        checking the iotc_state_t parameter of the callback.

        if state == IOTC_STATE_OK , the application intentionally disconnected
        if state != IOTC_STATE_OK , the disconnection was unexpected, and the
   state contains an error code as to what happened.

        In the case of this example,
        the application's response to a successful connection is to create a
            repeating timed task to publish a message on the configured topic.
            If an intentional disconnection occurs, then the client application
            exists.  If an unforeseen disconnection occurs, or if the connection
            fails, then the application reattempts the connection.  */
